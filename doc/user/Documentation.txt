This is the User-Documentation for AMerge.

What is AMerge?
AMerge is a small c++ program, written to manage big archives of images to
which names ar not relevant (because amerge will rename them and number them).

How to invoke AMerge?
Simply type
> amerge -a action indir1 indir2 ... indirN
but beware, not all options are compatible with all actions.

What is an Action?
An Action is simply a behaviour for AMerge, a Task to be done. As of the time
of this writing, there are four actions: create, defrag, insert and unique.

create needs a output directory (-o) and one or more input directories.
Optionally you can set the number from where to start numbering (-s) and you
can tell amerge to remove the source files after the work is done (-c).

defrag is usually invoked to close the gaps in the numbering scheme opened by
the action unique. It takes one or more input directories but no output
directory and the flag -c is ignored.

insert inserts the contents of one or more input directories into the
specified output directory. The special thing is, that insert expects a
already created directory (with action create) at output directory and that it
will determine automatically from where to start numbering, therefor is the
option -s ignored, but -c can still be used to remove the input directories
after the insert.

unique removes all duplicated files in the input_directories. It does not take
a output directory as parameter and the -s and -c parameters are without
effect.

What files can amerge manage?
amerge uses a hardcoded (at the moment at least) array to define filename
extensions, which are processed (as this program is aimed for image archives,
it will only find the most used extensions valid).
